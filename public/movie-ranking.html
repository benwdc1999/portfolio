<h1>My Current List of Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>The Top Three</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Hot Chick</h3>
<p>A 2002 comedy starring Rob Schneider. Very funny.</p>

<h3>Magnolia</h3>
<p>Released in 1999. Really catches the spirit of the end of the 90s I feel.</p>

<h3>Lord Of The Rings</h3>
<p>
  That was a great time for fantasy movies, and this was probably the biggest. I
  believe it came out in 2001.
